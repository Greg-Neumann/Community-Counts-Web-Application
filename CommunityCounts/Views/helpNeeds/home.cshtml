        <h3>Setup : Client Needs</h3>
        This section describes how Client Needs are <strong>defined</strong> to the system. A Client Need must be defined before any Client may be marked as having that Need.
        <h4>
            Security and permissions
        </h4>
        You must be a member of either of these roles to be able to define Surveys:
        <dl>
            <dt>
                systemAdmin
            </dt>
            <dd>
                The 'normal' special group that all Managers are member of. In any one centre, there is at least one member of Staff - the senior Manager - who has this security level.
                <br />      <br />
            </dd>
            <dt>
                canManageNeeds
            </dt>
            <dd>
                A special group that can be assigned to individual staff members that permits them to <strong>mark/unmark Needs</strong> against any particular Client (Work With: Clients, then selecting the <a href="#" class="btn btn-warning btn-xs">Needs</a> button)
                <br />
            </dd>
        </dl>
        All other staff members will be blocked from either Setup: Client Needs or selecting the <a href="#" class="btn btn-warning btn-xs">Needs</a> button.

        New Surveys are created by Selecting the <em>Setup</em> menu item and then selecting the <em>Client Needs</em> sub-menu item. If you do not have permissions to do this act, you will be blocked from seeing the screen shown shown to the left.
        You then press the <a href="#" class="btn btn-warning btn-xs">Create New</a> button at the top of the screen.
        <p>
            You may enter any text to describe your new Need. When created, it will be listed alphabetically with all other existing Client Needs. This usually means that you should use some sort of <em>naming</em> convention such as prefixing all 'Personal Development' type Needs
            with the text 'Personal Devl - &lt; rest of Need text &gt' so that they all group tegether when so listed. If you make a mistake, no worries as you can simply edit any Client Need and change it's name. This will NOT affect any such Needs already assigned to a Client (other than the name of that Need). Use the <a href="#" class="btn btn-warning btn-xs">Edit</a> button shown above to do this.
        </p>
        <p>
            Any Client Need that is not in-use may be deleted at any time. This means that you may press the <a href="#" class="btn btn-danger btn-xs">Delete</a> button against any Client Need Category. If this Need Category is marked as 'ticked' against any Client, then you will not be able to delete this category.
            If this Need Category is not 'ticked' against any Client, then the Need Category will be deleted and it will no longer be listed as a possible Client Need against any Client even if it is already listed (but not 'ticked').

        You record any Client Needs against any existing Client by selecting the menu item <em>>Work With: Client Needs</em> and selecting the <a href="#" class="btn btn-warning btn-xs">Needs</a> button. You will then be presented this screen:

            <p>
                On this screen, only a selected date is mandatory. The date chosen must reside within the current business registration year. You may switch registration years (<em>Setup : Change Years</em>) to enter Client Needs outside of the one you are currently using.
                You may also enter any textural notes against this Client Need. To give you room to enter these notes, you may make the text area bigger by left-clicking (and holding), followed by dragging down/to the right as shown above. These notes may be extensive (there
                is a system limit of 65,535 characters - about 36 pages of a typical novel.)

            <p>
                When you are done, press the <a href="#" class="btn btn-warning btn-xs">Enter Needs</a> button to both save these notes and go to the Client Needs tick-list as shown below.
