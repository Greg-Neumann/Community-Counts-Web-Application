            <br />Normally this is in the <strong>previous</strong> registration year but may not be necessarily so. This is because <em>ClientIDPrev</em> is set when a client <strong>from any year</strong> is copied forward to another
            year Hence, <em>ClientIDPrev</em> may refer to any number of years ago but is definately this same client in a previous year to the current year.
            <p>
                You can use this value to determine if a client is a 'repeat' client or not in that it will have the value of 'blank' if this is a new registration in the current year and will not be blank (will contain a number) if this client
                was previously registered.
