                    <em>Registration Year</em> is now mandatory within Community Counts.
                    <p>
                        Upon logging onto Community Counts, you are
                        logged onto work with the same <em>registration year</em> that you last used, which defaults to the <strong>current</strong>
                        <em>registration year</em> for your first logon.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        You can change this <em>registration year</em> by using the menu action <em>Setup : Change Year</em> which will then become the
                        default <em>registration year</em> for you unless you change it again.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    Client details can now be copied to another registration year by pressing the <a href="#" class="btn btn-danger btn-xs">Copy</a> button on the <a href="/C1Client" class="info alert-link">Client list screen</a><br />
                    <a href="#" class="alert-warning">Important!</a> When a Client record is copied to another year:

                            All details present on the Client record are copied exactly except the 'Confirmed Signed' tick-box which must be re-confirmed.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Upon copying a Client, you are then presented with that new client in <a href="#" class="btn btn-danger btn-xs">Edit</a> mode so you make changes accordingly.

                            The new Client has no enrollments or any associated activities in that new year; You must re-enroll accordingly.

            <strong>Bug Fixes and enhancements</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    The Client list screen now defaults to listing the <em>most recently</em> created clients, but still sorted in alphabetical order of their last name.
                    <p>
                        This is intended to make it easier to find, in the list, clients which have just been created; for they will always be present in the list screen after they are <em>just</em> created.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The Client ID is also listed along side their name to ease identification.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    Ensure that the date-picker (calendar) appears on the Client enrollment screen when enrolling (it always did when changing an enrollment)
                </li>
                <li>
                    Activities can now be ended. This means that clients cannot be enrolled in it from after the Activity Ended Date.
                    <ul>
                        <li>The end date can be any date from the date that the Activity was last attendance marked.</li>
                        <li>If an Activity is so ended (in <em>Setup: Activities</em>), then that Activity is no longer listed after that date for enrollment (or journeying) by Clients in <em>Work with: Clients</em></li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    Schedules are now listed (in <em>Setup : Schedules</em>) sorted by the name of the room, then by the name of the activity and then by the start Date/Time to aid identification of each schedule.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Deleting a Schedule no longer crashes if there are related Attendance records for that Schedule.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The Client details screen now displays the current <em>Client ID</em> <strong>and</strong> the <em>Previous Client ID</em>. The latter applies when a Client record has been copied from another registration year.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The Drop-down list of Activities displayed when enrolling a Client, or Journeying them,  is now sorted into alphabetical order (sorry!)
                </li>
                <li>
                    The Scheduling frequency type of &quot;Annual&quot; has been renamed to &quot;One Off&quot; to more reflect it's actual usage. This is a name-change only and does not affect the way this works.
